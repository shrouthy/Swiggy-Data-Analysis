# Swiggy-Data-Analysis
As a Data Analyst at Swiggy, implement sophisticated SQL queries with intricate joins for in-depth analysis and strategic decision-making.

**Objective:**  
Conduct in-depth SQL-driven analysis on Swiggy’s customer, restaurant, and order data to uncover patterns in user behavior, restaurant performance, and operational efficiency — helping drive strategic decisions.

**Project Highlights:**  
**1. Customer Insights:**  
* Identified active customer clusters (e.g., in Delhi).
* Flagged dormant users who've never ordered — potential retargeting segment.
* Tracked order frequency and behavioral patterns (e.g., 3-day order customers).

**2. Restaurant Performance:**
* Analyzed restaurant ratings city-wise (e.g., Mumbai average).
* Ranked top 5 restaurants by consistent rating quality.
* Measured revenue contributions from each restaurant.

**3. Delivery & Operations:**  
* Assessed delivery partner activity to spot high-efficiency zones.
* City-specific order volumes (e.g., Mumbai) to guide staffing and logistics.

**Tools Used:**
* SQL – Advanced queries, multi-table joins, conditional filtering.
* Domain Context – Food delivery operations, customer lifecycle, platform engagement.

**Takeaways:**
* A large portion of new users never order — conversion drop-off opportunity.
* Top-rated restaurants offer clear promotion potential.
* Behavioral segmentation (based on order frequency) can refine loyalty campaigns.
* Delivery partner data shows promising zones for scaling or optimization.
